# ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project to *detect fraudulent transactions* using historical data and feature-based analysis. The goal is to build a robust model that accurately distinguishes between *legitimate* and *fraudulent* transactions, helping organizations minimize financial losses and improve security.

ðŸ§  Project Overview

Fraudulent activities are a major challenge for financial institutions. In this project, we use machine learning techniques to classify transactions as *fraudulent* or *non-fraudulent*.  
The dataset is preprocessed, imbalanced classes are handled, and multiple ML models are trained and evaluated to find the best performer.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- The dataset consists of historical transaction records with various features.  
- It includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.  
- Since fraud cases are usually rare, the dataset is *highly imbalanced, which is addressed using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)*.

> âš  Dataset is not included due to privacy â€” you can use a public fraud dataset (e.g., [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)) or your own data.
